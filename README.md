# BUILDING-AND-USING-PERSONAL-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH-TO-IMPROVE-SUICIDAL-IDEATION-DETECTION-ON-SOCIAL-MEDIA

The surge in suicidal ideation expressed across social media platforms underscores a pressing societal concern, compounded by the complexities arising from data scarcity and limited contextual understanding. Existing methodologies struggle to discern genuine indicators of suicidal intent amidst sparse and implicit data, thereby undermining detection accuracy. To address this challenge, this study leverages insights from psychology and proposes a novel solution through the development of a comprehensive suicide-oriented knowledge graph integrated with deep neural networks. By amalgamating psychological insights with advanced technology, our approach aims to mitigate the obstacles posed by data challenges and knowledge constraints. Focusing on intricate details such as user-generated content, personality traits, and life experiences, our methodology endeavours to furnish a more precise and insightful framework for detecting suicidal ideation on social media platforms.
